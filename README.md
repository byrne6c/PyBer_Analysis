# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this Analysis is to prepare an exploritory analysis, comparing several visualization to tell story about Pyber Ride-Share data. The chart visualizations will display the relationships between factors such as total number of drivers, fare amounts & number of rides per city type. 

## Results: 

A few observations noted from the Ride-Sharing Summary Database image:
* Rural areas have the least amount of rides totaled over time, yet this area has the highest average fare per ride. 

* Urban areas make the largest totaled revenue from ride-share services & having the largest number of drivers,  while sustaining the cheapest average fare per ride. 

* Suburban results sit as a fair median within our data values across the board. With that being said, as potentially unpredictable this city data could have been, the Total Fare for Suburban cities proven to make a substantial amount of revenue. Almost half of Urban cities totals, consideing a $6 increase to the average fare per ride in this area.

## Summary: 
Business Recommendations based on our Multiline Chart "Total Fare by City Type": 
* Noting the clear success rate within Urban city data, I believe it would be safe judgement to explore new ideas & continue to invest in improving services provided within this area. This can be especially lucrative considering   

* Take a closer, more detailed analysis of the Suburban data. Identify factors that contribute to extreme lows in numbers, like time periods between Januray - February & February - March. 

* To honor the intent of improving access & affordability to ride sharing services, definitly take advantage of survery services. Provide insentives for users to share feedback from all city areas. We can best assess how to maximize our gains & cut down on losses, as well as discover unknown determining factors like public/personal transport compared to Pyber services.
